<p>what is html boilerpoint</p>

<p >its like a templete that is used in web pages html site, the basics tags like "head", "body","title" etc <p>
<p>mojibake: characters that are changed because of the browser we are using sometimes , wrong encoding can make the website look messed up so to not let that
    happen,check in unicod table which also shows emojis and we should use utf-8 as meta charset  example:
    <!--"<meta charset="utf-8>"-->
    everything that is in unicode can be encoded correctly in utf-8.
